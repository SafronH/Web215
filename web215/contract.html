    <h3>WEB 215-85 Course Contract</h3>
    <p>I, Safron Haile agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2019, Web-215-85, Advanced Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Prof. D.I. von Briesen.
    </p>
    <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
    <p id="signature">Signed: <a href="introduction.html">Safron Haile</a> , 01/13/2020</p>
